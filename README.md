# AutoApplyPro

**AutoApplyPro** is a cross-platform job application system designed to automate the application process, intelligently matching candidates to job postings and applying on their behalf.  
Its core innovation is the **Auto-Apply Algorithm**, which analyzes both user profile data and uploaded resume content to determine the best job matches.

Currently in **active development**, the system focuses on the MVP stage, implementing the backend intelligence and essential UI, with scope for UI refinements, resume template customization, and deployment as a unique job automation service in the future.

## üöÄ Features (MVP)

### **For Job Seekers**
- **Auto-Apply Job Applications** ‚Äì Automatically applies to matching job postings once a threshold match score is reached.
- **Weighted Job Matching Algorithm** ‚Äì Compares candidate skills, education, and location with job requirements.
- **Form-Based Resume Input** ‚Äì Users fill out structured resume fields and can upload an external CV file (PDF or other generic file types).
- **Opt-In Auto-Apply Preference** ‚Äì Auto-Apply is **not enabled by default**. The system promotes the feature to new seekers, but it is entirely up to the user to subscribe/enable it in their preferences.
- **Profile & CV Completion Check** ‚Äì If a user subscribes to Auto-Apply without having a completed profile or uploaded CV, the system redirects them to complete their profile and CV before enabling the feature.
- **Client-Server Architecture** ‚Äì Decoupled frontend and backend communicating via REST APIs.
- **MySQL Database Integration** ‚Äì Stores user data, job postings, and application history securely.
- **Duplicate Prevention** ‚Äì Ensures the system does not re-apply for the same job for the same user.


### **For Employers**
- **Registration & Login** ‚Äì Employers can create accounts to manage their job postings.
- **Job Posting** ‚Äì Employers can create new job listings with skill, education, and location requirements.
- **Job Management Dashboard** ‚Äì View, update, and delete previously created jobs.
- **Applicant Viewing** ‚Äì View all applicants for each job in a **nested card-based UI**, making it easy to review candidate details.

## üìÇ Project Setup Instructions

After pulling or extracting the project directory, you will see two main folders:

FRONTEND/ # Root directory for the frontend server
BACKEND/ # Contains backend server files and database file


### 1. Frontend Setup
- Navigate to the `FRONTEND` folder.
- Open it in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- This folder contains the root files for the frontend server.

### 2. Backend Setup
Inside the `BACKEND` folder, you will find:
- `AAP-backend/` ‚Üí Root directory for backend (Node.js + Express) server files.
- `db.sql` (or similar) ‚Üí SQL database file.

Open the `AAP-backend` folder in your code editor for backend development.

### 3. Database Configuration
- Import the SQL file from the `BACKEND` folder into your MySQL server (e.g., using phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench).
- Create a local MySQL instance with:
  - **User:** `root`
  - **Password:** *(your local MySQL password)*
- Open the `.env` file inside the `AAP-backend` folder and update the database credentials accordingly:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name



### 4. Run the Application

#### Backend:
```bash
cd BACKEND/AAP-backend
npm install
npm start
```


#### Frontend:
Navigate to the FRONTEND folder.
Open index.html directly in your browser or use a local server.
Note: Ensure both the frontend and backend are running for the application to function correctly.



#### üìå Status
Current Focus: Backend intelligence and core auto-apply functionality.

##### Pending Improvements:
Customizable resume templates in the Resume Builder.
Advanced parsing of uploaded CV files for richer matching.
Additional job data sources.
UI enhancements for a smoother user experience.



#### üìù License
This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
Future iterations may evolve into a deployable SaaS platform.
